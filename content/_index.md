Hi, nice to meet you. I am a PhD student in computer science, and my research
is about keeping shared state consistent in both concurrent and distributed
systems. You may know me from my contributions to the [CALM
theorem](https://cris.vub.be/ws/portalfiles/portal/97428175/dcbq.pdf), and
my work on [transaction
scheduling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10597797). I enjoy combining
theoretical computer science with databases and systems programming. My hope is that the ideas
I contribute to make your job as a wrangler of flickering lights more enjoyable.

I am enrolled in a PhD program at the Software Languages Lab of the Vrije
Universiteit Brussel, where I am advised by [Bas
Ketsman](http://basketsman.com). In the context of my PhD I did a 3-month research visit
at UC Berkeley, where I worked together
with [Joe Hellerstein](https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/).
Before my PhD, I completed a 6-month internship at IBM's Research Lab in
ZÃ¼rich under the guidance of [Peter Staar](https://research.ibm.com/people/peter-staar).
