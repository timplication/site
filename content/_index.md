I started my Ph.D. in October 2021 under the guidance of
[Prof. Dr. Bas Ketsman](http://basketsman.com), at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB). Some
of the topics I have worked on include coordination-freedom in distributed
systems (CALM), distributed worst-case optimal joins, and optimal transaction
scheduling.

Prior to being a Ph.D. student, I did an internship at [IBM Research
ZÃ¼rich](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/ics/) in the group of [Dr.
Staar](https://research.ibm.com/people/peter-staar).
